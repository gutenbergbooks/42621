<p>"Good Reader, many things hath beene written by many men, and the
over-cloying humor of this age hath so overburdened the world with
multiplicity of al kinds, that scarce there is one subject left upon the
head whereof a hundred have not trampled over: amongst which impartial
handling, it may bee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> possible that some one corner hath escaped this
scrutenous search, and beene raked over with a lighter hand than other."</p>

<p>We feel the justice of this remark as applicable to modern poetry. Much
novelty cannot be expected. In submitting the following volume to the
public, we attempt neither to prejudice them in its favour, or
supplicate them in behalf of its faults.</p>

<span class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>As on I journey through the vale of years,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cheer'd by fond hopes, and chill'd by doubtful fears;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Allow me, Memory, in thy treasur'd store,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To view those days that will return no more:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! let thy vivid pencil call to view<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each distant scene, each long-past hour anew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ere yet my bosom knew the touch of grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ere yet my bosom lov'd the lyre's relief.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Yes, as thou dart'st thine intellectual ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The clouds of mental darkness melt away:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So when, at earliest day's awaking dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The hovering mists obscure the dewy lawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O'er all the champain spread their influence chill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hang o'er the vale, and hide the lofty hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Anon, slow rising, beams the orb of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Slow melt the shadowy mists, and fade away;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">The vapours vanish at the view of morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hang in dew-drops on the glistening thorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The prospect opens on the pilgrim's sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hills, and vales, and woods, reflect the beam of light.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">O thou! the mistress of my future days,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Accept thy minstrel's retrospective lays;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To whom the minstrel and the lyre belong,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Accept, <span class="smcap">Ariste</span>, Memory's pensive song!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Memory on thine image loves to hang,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heave the sad sigh, and point the piercing pang.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of long-past days I sing, ere yet I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or grief and care, or happiness and you;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ere yet my infant bosom learnt to prove<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The pangs of absence, and the hopes of love.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">So when the pilgrim, on his journey bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With upward toil creeps on the steep ascent;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ere yet his feet the destin'd height attain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oft will he pause, and gaze the journey'd plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oft pause again, the valley to survey,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where food or slumber sooth'd his wand'ring way.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><span class="smcap">Alston</span>! twelve years, in various business fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have wing'd their restless flight o'er <span class="smcap">Bion</span>'s head;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Twelve years have taught his opening mind to know<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The smiles of pleasure, and the frowns of woe;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Since in thy vale, beneath the master's rule,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He roam'd an inmate of the village school:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet still will memory's busy eye retrace<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each well-known vestige of the oft-trod place;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each wonted haunt, each scene of youthful joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where merriment has cheer'd the careless boy:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Well pleas'd will memory still the spot survey,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where once he triumph'd in the infant play,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Without one care where every morn he rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where every evening sunk to calm repose.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Large was the mansion, fall'n by varying fate<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From lordly grandeur and manorial state;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where once the manor's lord supreme had rule,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now reign'd the master of the village school:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No more was heard around, at earliest morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The echoing clangor of the huntsman's horn;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No more the eager hounds, with deep'ning cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yell'd in the exulting hope of pastime nigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The squire no more obey'd the morning call,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor favourite spaniels fill'd the sportsman's hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For he, the last descendant of his race,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Slept with his fathers, and forgot the chace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Fall'n was the mansion: o'er the village poor<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The lordly landlord tyrannized no more;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">For now, in petty greatness o'er the school,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The mighty master held despotic rule:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With trembling silence all his deeds we saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His look a mandate, and his word a law;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Severe his voice, severely grave his mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wond'rous strict he was, and wond'rous wise, I ween.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Even now, thro' many a long long year, I trace<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The hour when first in awe I view'd his face;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Even now recall my entrance at the dome,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas the first day I ever left my home!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Years intervening have not worn away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The deep remembrance of that distant day;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Effac'd the vestige of my earliest fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A mother's fondness, and a mother's tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When close she prest me to her sorrowing heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As loath as even I myself to part.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">But time to youthful sorrow yields relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each various object weans the child from grief:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like April showers the tears of youth descend,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sudden they fall, and suddenly they end;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Serener pleasure gilds the following hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As brighter gleams the sun when past the April shower.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Methinks ev'n now the interview I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Recall the mistress' smile, the master's glee:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Much of my future happiness they said,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Much of the easy life the scholars led;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of spacious play-ground, and of wholsome air,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The best instruction, and the tenderest care;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And when I follow'd from the garden door<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My father, 'till with tears I saw no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How civilly they eas'd my parting pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And never spake so civilly again!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Why loves the soul on earlier years to dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When memory spreads around her saddening spell;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When discontent, with sullen gloom o'ercast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Loaths at the present, and prefers the past?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why calls reflection to my pensive view<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each trifling act of infancy anew&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each trifling act with pleasure pondering o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Even at the time when trifles please no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Day follows day, yet leaves no trace behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When one sole thought engrosses all the mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When anxious reason claims her painful sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And for to-morrow's prospect glooms to-day!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ill fares the wanderer in this vale of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When each new stage affords succeeding strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In every stage he feels supremely curst,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet still the present evil seems the worst:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">On as he goes the vision'd prospect flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, grasping still at bliss, unblest at last he dies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Yet is remembrance sweet; though well I know<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The days of childhood are but days of woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some rude restraint, some petty tyrant sours<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The tranquil calm of childhood's easy hours;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some trifling fault committed calls the tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some trifling task neglected prompts to fear:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet is it sweet to call to mind the hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ere searching reason gain'd her saddening power;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ere future prospects could the soul distress,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When even ignorance was happiness.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Such was my state in those remember'd years,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When one small acre bounded all my fears:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And even now with pleasure I recall<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The tapestry'd school, the bright-brown boarded hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The murmuring brook, that every morning saw<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The due observance of the cleanly law;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The walnuts, where, when favour would allow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Full oft I wont to search each well-stript bough;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The crab-tree, whence we hid the secret hoard,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With roasted crabs to deck the wintry board.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Thy soften'd warblings meet my pensive ear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Why art thou silent? wherefore sleeps thy lay?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The shrieking owlet hails the shadowy hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hoarse hums the beetle as he drones along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hour of love is flown! thy full-fledg'd brood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer need thy care to cull their food,<br /></span>
